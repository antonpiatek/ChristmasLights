This is a C program compilable with the mspgcc toolchain
for a TI MSP430 microcontroller (like MSP430 launchpad).
It drives a WS2801 based string of RGB LEDs (or 2
strings, or more...) to create lights for a christmass
tree.

Compile with "make", or "make prog" to program too if
you are uing Linux and mspdebug.

It is extensible, you can add your own patterns fairly
easily.

fade_table.pl	Perl script to make lookup tables used to define a sub-pixel in a fadable colour.
HOW_TO_DEBUG	I can never remember how to invoke ddd.
modes.txt	Loose description of patterns I want to make.
